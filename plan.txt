Specific to CS and the tech industry, to succeed in the workplace as a software engineer/programmer, you really need just 5 classes - data structures, computer architecture, algorithms, operating systems, computer networking. Optionally, a class in compilers would be useful to get familiar with programming state machines. All of this can be done in about 1 year post high school, assuming the student has done a lot of programming in high school.
